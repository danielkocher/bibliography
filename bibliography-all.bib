  abstract  = {Tree-structured data are becoming ubiquitous nowadays and manipulating them based on similarity is essential for many applications. Although similarity search on textual data has been extensively studied, searching for similar trees is still an open problem due to the high complexity of computing the similarity between trees, especially for large numbers of tress. In this paper, we propose to transform tree-structured data into strings with a one-to-one mapping. We prove that the edit distance of the corresponding strings forms a bound for the similarity measures between trees, including tree edit distance, largest common subtrees and smallest common super-trees. Based on the theoretical analysis, we can employ any existing algorithm of approximate string search for effective similarity search on trees. Moreover, we embed the bound into a filter-and-refine framework for facilitating similarity search on tree-structured data. The experimental results show that our algorithm achieves high performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly. Our method is especially suitable for accelerating similarity query processing on large numbers of trees in massive datasets.},

We present an explicit, simple, and time-optimal algorithm for solving this problem for unrooted unordered labeled trees, and show that the running time of our method is linear with respect to the size of T. By unordered, we mean that the order of the adjacent nodes (children/neighbors) of any node of T is irrelevant. An unrooted tree T does not have a node that is designated as root and can also be referred to as an undirected tree. We show how the presented algorithm can easily be modified to operate on trees that do not satisfy some or any of the aforementioned assumptions on the tree structure; for instance, how it can be applied to rooted, ordered or unlabeled trees.},
