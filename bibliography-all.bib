  abstract  = {Tree-structured data are becoming ubiquitous nowadays and manipulating them based on similarity is essential for many applications. Although similarity search on textual data has been extensively studied, searching for similar trees is still an open problem due to the high complexity of computing the similarity between trees, especially for large numbers of tress. In this paper, we propose to transform tree-structured data into strings with a one-to-one mapping. We prove that the edit distance of the corresponding strings forms a bound for the similarity measures between trees, including tree edit distance, largest common subtrees and smallest common super-trees. Based on the theoretical analysis, we can employ any existing algorithm of approximate string search for effective similarity search on trees. Moreover, we embed the bound into a filter-and-refine framework for facilitating similarity search on tree-structured data. The experimental results show that our algorithm achieves high performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly. Our method is especially suitable for accelerating similarity query processing on large numbers of trees in massive datasets.},

We present an explicit, simple, and time-optimal algorithm for solving this problem for unrooted unordered labeled trees, and show that the running time of our method is linear with respect to the size of T. By unordered, we mean that the order of the adjacent nodes (children/neighbors) of any node of T is irrelevant. An unrooted tree T does not have a node that is designated as root and can also be referred to as an undirected tree. We show how the presented algorithm can easily be modified to operate on trees that do not satisfy some or any of the aforementioned assumptions on the tree structure; for instance, how it can be applied to rooted, ordered or unlabeled trees.},

  abstract  = {Information retrieval encounters a migration from the traditional paradigm (returning an ordered list of responses) to the aggregate search paradigm (grouping the most comprehensive and relevant answers into one final aggregated document). Nowadays extensible markup language (XML) is an important standard of information exchange and representation. Usually the tree representation of documents and queries is used to process them. It allows to consider the XML documents retrieval as a tree matching problem between the document trees and the query tree. Several paradigms for retrieving XML documents have been proposed in the literature but only a few of them try to aggregate a set of XML documents in order to provide more significant answers for a given query. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an aggregated search method to obtain the most accurate and richest answers in XML fragment search. Our search method is based on the Top-k Approximate Subtree Matching (TASM) algorithm and a new similarity function is proposed to improve the returned fragments. Then an aggregation process is presented to generate a single aggregate response containing the most relevant, exhaustive and non-redundant information given by the fragments. The method is evaluated on two real world datasets. Experimentations show that it generates good results in terms of relevance and quality.},

  abstract = {Recent IR extensions to XML query languages such as Xpath 1.0 Full-Text or the NEXI query language of the INEX benchmark series reflect the emerging interest in IR-style ranked retrieval over semistructured data. TopX is a top-k retrieval engine for text and semistructured data. It terminates query execution as soon as it can safely determine the k top-ranked result elements according to a monotonic score aggregation function with respect to a multidimensional query. It efficiently supports vague search on both content- and structure-oriented query conditions for dynamic query relaxation with controllable influence on the result ranking. The main contributions of this paper unfold into four main points: (1) fully implemented models and algorithms for ranked XML retrieval with XPath Full-Text functionality, (2) efficient and effective top-k query processing for semistructured data, (3) support for integrating thesauri and ontologies with statistically quantified relationships among concepts, leveraged for word-sense disambiguation and query expansion, and (4) a comprehensive description of the TopX system, with performance experiments on large-scale corpora like TREC Terabyte and INEX Wikipedia.},

  abstract = {In data integration applications, a join matches elements that are common to two data sources. Since elements are represented slightly different in each source, an approximate join must be used to do the matching. For XML data, most existing approximate join strategies are based on some ordered tree matching technique, such as the tree edit distance. In data-centric XML, however, the sibling order is irrelevant, and two elements should match even if their subelement order varies. Thus, approximate joins for data-centric XML must leverage unordered tree matching techniques. This is computationally hard since the algorithms cannot rely on a predefined sibling order. In this paper, we give a solution for approximate joins based on unordered tree matching. The core of our solution are windowed pq-grams which are small subtrees of a specific shape. We develop an efficient technique to generate windowed pq-grams in a three-step process: sort the tree, extend the sorted tree with dummy nodes, and decompose the extended tree into windowed pq-grams. The windowed pq-grams distance between two trees is the number of pq-grams that are in one tree decomposition only. We show that our distance is a pseudo-metric and empirically demonstrate that it effectively approximates the unordered tree edit distance. The approximate join using windowed pq-grams can be efficiently implemented as an equality join on strings, which avoids the costly computation of the distance between every pair of input trees. Experiments with synthetic and real world data confirm the analytic results and show the effectiveness and efficiency of our technique.},

  abstract = {A product Bill of Materials (BOM) is a structured tree which represents its components and their hierarchal relationships. The BOMs are traditionally used for Material Requirement Planning (MRP). However, they do have other useful applications in product modeling and variety management. Recent research used graph difference operations, linear algebra and integer programming to match trees of BOM and find pairwise similarity measures for applications such as clustering product variants into families and retrieval of design and manufacturing data. Matching phylogenetic trees has been utilized in biological science for decades and is referred to as “tree reconciliation”. A new application of this approach in manufacturing to match pairs of BOM trees and retrieve the most similar design is presented. This novel method can help speeding-up other downstream planning activities such as process planning, hence, improving productivity and shortening time to market. Assembly of chemical processing centrifugal pumps is used as a case study for demonstration. This novel matching of Bills of Materials uses linear time algorithms, compared to state-of- the-art algorithms which use integer programming and matrix approximation, hence, leading to more computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {Clustering refers to the process of extracting maximally coherent groups from a set of objects using pairwise, or high-order, similarities. Traditional approaches to this problem are based on the idea of partitioning the input data into a predetermined number of classes, thereby obtaining the clusters as a by-product of the partitioning process. A radically different perspective of the problem consists in providing a formalization of the very notion of a cluster and considering the clustering process as a sequential search of structures in the data adhering to this cluster notion. In this manuscript we review one of the pioneering approaches falling in the latter class of algorithms, which has been proposed in the early 2000s and has been found since then a number of applications in different domains. It is known as dominant set clustering and provides a notion of a cluster (a.k.a. dominant set) that has intriguing links to game-theory, graph-theory and optimization theory. From the game-theoretic perspective, clusters are regarded as equilibria of non-cooperative “clustering” games; in the graph-theoretic context, it can be shown that they generalize the notion of maximal clique to edge-weighted graphs; finally, from an optimization point of view, they can be characterized in terms of solutions to a simplex-constrained, quadratic optimization problem, as well as in terms of an exquisitely combinatorial entity. Besides introducing dominant sets from a theoretical perspective, we will also focus on the related algorithmic issues by reviewing two state-of-the-art methods that are used in the literature to find dominant sets clusters, namely the Replicator Dynamics and the Infection and Immunization Dynamics. Finally, we conclude with an overview of different extensions of the dominant set framework and of applications where dominant sets have been successfully employed.},

  abstract  = {Over the last decade, there has been a tremendous growth in data-intensive applications and services in the cloud. Data is created on a variety of edge sources, e.g., devices, browsers, and servers, and processed by cloud applications to gain insights or take decisions. Applications and services either work on collected data, or monitor and process data in real time. These applications are typically update intensive and involve a large amount of state beyond what can fit in main memory. However, they display significant temporal locality in their access pattern. This paper presents FASTER, a new key-value store for point operations. FASTER combines a highly cache-optimized concurrent hash index with a "hybrid log": a concurrent log-structured record store that spans main memory and storage, while supporting fast in-place updates of the hot set in memory. FASTER extends the standard key-value store interface to handle read-modify-writes, blind updates, and CRDT-based updates. Experiments show that FASTER achieves orders-of-magnitude better throughput - up to 160M operations per second on a single machine - than alternative systems deployed widely today, and exceeds the performance of pure in-memory data structures when the workload fits in memory.},

  abstract = {Set similarity join, which finds all the similar set pairs from two collections of sets, is a fundamental problem with a wide range of applications. Existing works study both exact set similarity join and approximate similarity join problems. In this paper, we focus on the exact set similarity join problem. The existing solutions for exact set similarity join follow a filtering-verification framework, which generates a list of candidate pairs through scanning indexes in the filtering phase and reports those similar pairs in the verification phase. Though much research has been conducted on this problem, set relations have not been well studied on improving the algorithm efficiency through computational cost sharing. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the set relations in different levels to reduce the overall computational cost. First, it has been shown that most of the computational time is spent on the filtering phase, which can be quadratic to the number of sets in the worst case for the existing solutions. Thus, we explore index-level set relations to reduce the filtering cost while keeping the same filtering power. We achieve this by grouping related sets into blocks in the index and skipping useless index probes in joins. Second, we explore answer-level set relations to further improve the algorithm based on the intuition that if two sets are similar, their answers may have a large overlap. We derive an algorithm which incrementally generates the answer of one set from an already computed answer of another similar set rather than compute the answer from scratch to reduce the computational cost. In addition, considering that in real applications, the data are usually updated dynamically, we extend our techniques and design efficient algorithms to incrementally update the join result when any element in the sets is updated. Finally, we conduct extensive performance studies using 21 real datasets with various data properties from a wide range of domains. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms all the existing algorithms across all datasets.},

For obtaining a ``flat'' partition consisting of only the most significant clusters (possibly corresponding to different density thresholds), we propose a novel cluster stability measure, formalize the problem of maximizing the overall stability of selected clusters, and formulate an algorithm that computes an optimal solution to this problem. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current, state-of-the-art, density-based clustering methods on a wide variety of real world data.},

  abstract = {Exact set similarity join is a notoriously expensive operation, for which several solutions have been proposed. Recently, there have been studies that present a comparative analysis using MapReduce or a non-parallel setting. Our contribution is that we complement these works through conducting a thorough evaluation of the state-of-the-art GPU-enabled techniques. These techniques are highly diverse in their key features and our experiments manage to reveal the key strengths of each one. As we explain, in real-life applications there is no dominant solution. Depending on specific dataset and query characteristics, each solution, even not using the GPU at all, has its own sweet spot. All our work is repeatable and extensible.},

  abstract = {The Exact Set Similarity Join problem aims to find all similar sets between two collections of sets, with respect to a threshold and a similarity function such as Overlap, Jaccard, Dice or Cosine. The naïve approach verifies all pairs of sets and it is often considered impractical due the high number of combinations. So, Exact Set Similarity Join algorithms are usually based on the Filter-Verification Framework, that applies a series of filters to reduce the number of verified pairs. This paper presents a new filtering technique called Bitmap Filter, which is able to accelerate state-of-the-art algorithms for the exact Set Similarity Join problem. The Bitmap Filter uses hash functions to create bitmaps of fixed b bits, representing characteristics of the sets. Then, it applies bitwise operations (such as xor and population count) on the bitmaps in order to infer a similarity upper bound for each pair of sets. If the upper bound is below a given similarity threshold, the pair of sets is pruned. The Bitmap Filter benefits from the fact that bitwise operations are efficiently implemented by many modern general-purpose processors and it was easily applied to four state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in CPU: AllPairs, PPJoin, AdaptJoin and GroupJoin. Furthermore, we propose a Graphic Processor Unit (GPU) algorithm based on the naïve approach but using the Bitmap Filter to speedup the computation. The experiments considered 12 collections containing from 100 thousands up to 10 million sets and the joins were made using Jaccard thresholds from 0.50 to 0.95. The Bitmap Filter was able to improve 85% of the experiments in CPU, with speedups of up to 4.50× and 1.35× on average. Using the GPU algorithm, the experiments were able to speedup the original CPU algorithms by up to 577× using an Nvidia Geforce GTX 980 Ti.},

  abstract = {Similarity query processing is becoming increasingly important in many applications such as data cleaning, record linkage, Web search, and document analytics. In this paper we study how to provide end-to-end similarity query support natively in a parallel database system. We discuss how to express a similarity predicate in its query language, how to build indexes, how to answer similarity queries (selections and joins) efficiently in the runtime engine, possibly using indexes, and how to optimize similarity queries. One particular challenge is how to incorporate existing similarity join algorithms, which often require a series of steps to achieve a high efficiency, including collecting token frequencies, finding matching record id pairs, and reassembling result records based on id pairs. We present a novel approach that uses existing runtime operators to implement such complex join algorithms without reinventing the wheel; doing so positions the system to automatically benefit from future improvements to those operators. The approach includes a technique to transform a similarity join plan into an efficient operator-based physical plan during query optimization by using a template expressed largely in the system’s user-level query language; this technique greatly simplifies the specification of such a transformation rule. We use Apache AsterixDB, a parallel Big Data management system, to illustrate and validate our techniques. We conduct an experimental study using several large, real datasets on a parallel computing cluster to assess the similarity query support. We also include experiments involving three other parallel systems and report the efficacy and performance results.},
